Descriptive Statistics for a Sample Population

This application lets you create a normal distribution with 100-200 samples in it and set the seed used by R from 1-2000. Once those parameters are set, it plots a histogram showing the distribution of points along with some descriptive statistics for the population like the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean.

All of the interactive parts are on the left side of the screen: the seed and sample size can be changed using the two sliders, and the calculations can be toggled on/off by clicking on the checkboxes.

The code for this application can be found at <https://github.com/clin721/developing-data-products>.

The Shiny application is deployed on the ShinyApps.io server at <https://clin721.shinyapps.io/simple_stats/>.

The presentation that goes with this application is published on Rpubs at <http://rpubs.com/clin1002/300458>.
