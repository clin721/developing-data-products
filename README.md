Descriptive Statistics for a Sample Population

This application lets you create a normal distribution with 100-200 samples in it and set the seed used by R from 1-2000. Once those parameters are set, it plots a histogram showing the distribution of points along with some descriptive statistics for the population like the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean.
